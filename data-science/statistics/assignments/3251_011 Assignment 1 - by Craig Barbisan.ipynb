    "3. Calculate basic statistics measures for each group: the mean, median, standard deviation\n",

    "There are several tools you can use to generate boxplots within Jupyter/IPython notebooks. In class I used [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/box-plots/), but you can also use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/boxplot_demo.html), or [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html). Each of the above hyperlinks will demonstrate how to generate these plots. You should end up with a plot that contains:\n",

    "Since the mean and median are close within each group, we can infer that the data is normally distributed in each group. We can see from our standard deviation values that the typical observation in the beer group deviates from its mean more than the typical observation in the water group deviates from its mean. This tells us that the data points in the beer group are spread out over a wider range of values, which we can confirm by looking at the box plot for the 2 groups.\n",

    "Means are heavily influenced by values at the top or bottom of the range, or any outliers in the data, whereas medians are not affected by these extreme values. So outliers or skewed data can account for differences between means and medians. The standard deviation describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean. If the standard deviation is small, then the measurements are all going to be relatively close to the average. A higher standard deviation indicates that the numbers are more spread out over a wider range of values. A mean average on its own doesn't provide a complete picture without the standard deviation, if the typical observation varies greatly from the mean."
